# To-Do List Practice

This is a simple and functional to-do list web application built to practice front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Learned

- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, JSON handling, working with dates, and using array properties and methods.
- **HTML**: Semantic structuring of content.
- **CSS**: Designing a responsive and well-structured layout.

## Features

- Add tasks with a custom due date  
- Delete tasks individually  
- Tasks are dynamically displayed and updated using JavaScript

## What This Project Does

This program allows users to manage tasks by:
- Creating new to-do items with due dates  
- Displaying the list of tasks in real time  
- Deleting completed or unwanted tasks

It's a hands-on project to reinforce core front-end skills.
